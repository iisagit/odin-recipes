    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Follow these easy steps to turn eggs into beautiful, restaurant-quality cheesy omelettes. All it takes to fire up
        your own blue plate special are a couple of eggs, plus whatever cheese, veggies, and herbs you got chilling in
        the fridge. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2-3 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack and beat eggs with water in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or butter over medium heat in a large non-stick skillet. Pour in egg mixture. As eggs set around
            the edge of the skillet, with spatula, gently push cooked portions toward the center of the skillet. Tilt
            and rotate skillet to allow uncooked egg to flow into empty spaces.</li>
        <li>When eggs are almost set, add filling to half of the omelette, place a spatula under the un-filled half and
            fold over.</li>
    </ol>
